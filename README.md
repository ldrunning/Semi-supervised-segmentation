This network is an improvement based on the UniMatch network architecture.

## Usage

### UniMatch

```bash
# use torch.distributed.launch
sh scripts/train.sh <num_gpu> <port>
# to fully reproduce our results, the <num_gpu> should be set as 4 on all three datasets
# otherwise, you need to adjust the learning rate accordingly

# or use slurm
# sh scripts/slurm_train.sh <num_gpu> <port> <partition>
```

To train on other datasets or splits, please modify
``dataset`` and ``split`` in [train.sh](https://github.com/LiheYoung/UniMatch/blob/main/scripts/train.sh).

### FixMatch

Modify the ``method`` from ``'unimatch'`` to ``'fixmatch'`` in [train.sh](https://github.com/LiheYoung/UniMatch/blob/main/scripts/train.sh).

### Supervised Baseline

Modify the ``method`` from ``'unimatch'`` to ``'supervised'`` in [train.sh](https://github.com/LiheYoung/UniMatch/blob/main/scripts/train.sh), and double the ``batch_size`` in configuration file if you use the same number of GPUs as semi-supervised setting (no need to change ``lr``).
